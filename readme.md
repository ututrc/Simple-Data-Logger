# Simple Data Logger

Meteor 1.1 based data logging web service targeted for collecting user experience measurement data. Models data into user definable streams that can be used to feed in data via simple REST API. Provides rudimentary web UI to define the data streams as well as view and export the collected data.

Dat input API is identical to http://phant.io as this was developed as a quick replacement and will no longer be maintained.
